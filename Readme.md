## Project Overview
This repository contains solutions to a software engineering assessment. The assessment consists of two tasks:
1. **Task 1:** A chatbot decision-making flow, including a flowchart, explanation, pseudo-code, and Java implementation.
2. **Task 2:** A performance testing exercise to determine optimal test case selection for maximum functional coverage.

## Task 1: Chatbot Decision Flow
### Description
This task involves designing a chatbot that interacts with users, collecting relevant information while handling user input validation, missing data, and decision-making logic.

### Deliverables
- **Flowchart:** A structured diagram representing the chatbot’s decision-making process.
- **Explanation:** A detailed write-up justifying the chosen attributes and logic flow.
- **Pseudo-code:** A high-level representation of the chatbot’s logic.
- **Java Implementation:** A working Java program implementing the chatbot logic.

### Technologies Used
- Java 17
- PlantUML (for flowchart representation)

## Task 2: Performance Testing Optimization
### Description
This task involves identifying an optimal pair of test cases that together cover the maximum number of functionalities, while also identifying uncovered functionalities.

### Deliverables
- **Java Implementation:** A program that evaluates test case coverage and determines the best combination.

### Approach
- A set of test cases is mapped to the functionalities they cover.
- An algorithm iterates through combinations to determine the optimal pair that maximizes coverage.
- Any remaining uncovered functionalities are identified and displayed.

### Technologies Used
- Java 17

## How to Run the Code
1. Ensure you have Java 17 installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Compile and run the Java files
